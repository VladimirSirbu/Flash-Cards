# Flash-Cards
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other.

I was implemented this project with following action:
<br/>
- add (you can add a `flash-card` to your memory; this means add a `term` and a `definition`, ex: `France-Paris`)
- remove (remove a card from your memory; if you want to remove a card, you must be indicate the card's term)
- import (import a flash-card from a `.txt` file; card in file must be in this format `term:definition:mistakes`,ex: `France:Paris:2`; about mistakes below in description)
- export (export a card in a `.txt` file)
- ask (the program asks you about how many times you want to be asking about your cards; examples of this in the below screen)
- hardest card (when you were asked you probably made mistakes, and this mistakes hold in `mistake` section; example in below screen)
- exit (exit from the program);
